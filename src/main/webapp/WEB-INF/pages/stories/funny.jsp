		night this guy is speeding down the empty road. A cop sees him go
		flying past so chases him and pulls him over. The cop goes up to the
		car and when the man rolls down the window, he asks, "Are you aware of
		how fast you were going, sir?" The man replies, "Yes I am. I'm trying
		to escape a robbery I got involved in." The cop looks at him
		disbelievingly and asks him, "Were you the one being robbed, sir?" The
		man casually replies, "Oh no, I was the one who committed the robbery.
		I was escaping." The cop is shocked and surprised that the man has
		admitted this so freely. He says, "So you're telling me you were
		speeding...AND committed a robbery?" "Oh yes," replies the man calmly.
		"I have all the loot in the back." The cop is now starting to get
		angry and says, "Sir, I'm afraid you have to come with me" as he
		reaches into the window to take the car keys out of the ignition. The
		man shouts, "Don't do that! I'm afraid that you'll find the gun in my
		glove compartment!" At this the cop pulls his hand out of the window
		and says, "Wait here" as he returns to his car and calls for backup.

		Soon there are cars, cops and helicopters all over, everywhere you
		look. The man is quickly dragged out of his car, handcuffed and taken
		towards a cop car. However, just before he is put in the car and taken
		away a cop walks up to him and says, while pointing at the cop that
		pulled him over, "Sir, this officer tells us that you had committed a
		robbery, had stolen loot in the trunk of your car, and had a loaded
		gun in your glove compartment. However, we didn't find any of these
		things in your car." The man replies, "Yeah, and I bet that liar said
		I was speeding too!"</p>
